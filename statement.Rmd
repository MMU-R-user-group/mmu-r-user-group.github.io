#### Aims of the group

* to promote the R programming language across MMU
* to share knowledge of R
* to explore the use of R for a wide variety of purposes including statistical analysis, data science, GIS, reporting and others yet to be discovered
* to collaborate on problem solving using R
* to encourage reproducibility through the sharing of R code

#### Format

* R User Group meetings will be a mixture of presentations, drop-in surgeries and ad hoc training sessions
* The content of each meeting will be made up of contributions that have been volunteered by members of the group
* There will be a rotating chair so that the group is run and developed along cooperative lines

#### Outputs

* We will make all R User Group material available to members and the wider R community
* We will host a mini symposium each year to give members the opportunity to present their R outputs to the wider University

#### Modus operandi

* informal
* non-hierarchical - student and teaching / research staff will be treated as equals
* collaborative
* supportive
* welcoming to R users of all skill levels and those who are curious about the potential of R
